## Why?

The "Explore Sleep Quality" project is focused on creating a web application that helps users predict and improve their sleep quality based on various health and lifestyle factors. The core idea is to provide a personalized experience where users can input data about their daily activities, such as physical exercise and steps taken, and receive a prediction of their sleep quality on a scale of 1-10.
